*Record* is a simple set of macros to deal with errors.

It's heavily inspired by Zed Shaw's debug macros. Like, *heavily*.

It follows the usual C header library style: in one .c file, do this:

#+begin_src C 

#define RECORD_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "record.h"

#+end_src

A real readme with examples if forthcoming.
